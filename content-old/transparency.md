We publish a Transparency Report as part of our commitment to informing you about when and how governments ask us for information. This report details the types and numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement. We encourage you to review our Government Request and Transparency Report for more detailed information on our approach and response to government requests. 

## 2021 Report

During the period of July 2020 to July 2021 we received no requests for user information.
