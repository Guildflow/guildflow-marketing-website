## What makes Guildflow special?

Unlike Meetup.com which will sell your group to the first bidder if you cancel monthly payment fee or Facebook Events which perverts the privacy rights of members, Guildflow is about providing a modern space where group organizers have control over the group data and respectful privacy options to offer their members.

Being early in development, our feature offering is naturally smaller than those other platforms but hopefully the vision resonates with people. I'd love to [hear your feedback](/contact). You can also [join the newsletter](/newsletter) to hear what's coming next.

## Can I import my members from meetup.com?

One of the main reasons we are building Guildflow is because Meetup.com does not provide the group owner access to the member email addresses. There is no easy way to migrate out of meetup.com. 

**Meetup.com is like a roach motel. Once you go in, you can't get out.**

The simplest solution right now is to configure your group on Guildflow with a membership application, send your members the link and have them apply. Once you accept the application a new member account will be created for them and they can start to interact with the group.

I am looking into some import tools for past events and other group metadata but [welcome your feedback](/contact) on what you are looking for.

## Are there mobile apps for Guildflow?

Getting our API working is a foundational requirement for a native mobile app. Once the API is in a good place we'll start building out the mobile apps. The plan is to make these apps open source as well.

In the mean time, I will also say, the websites are built to support responsive design principals and will work great on phones and tablets. If you spot anything that you feel could me improved, [shoot me some feedback](/contact).

## I have an unanswered question!

Shoot me [an email](/contact) and I'll get back to you asap!
