If you would like to see what Guildflow is all about and have an opportunity to join the beta, you'll need to schedule a 30 minute video chat.

## [Schedule Demo and Beta Onboarding](https://calendly.com/zorn/guildflow)

During this video chat we review:

* Setup your group
* Demo how to create events
* Review how to add members
* Talk about group setting options
* And answer any other questions

Thanks so much for your interest and feedback about Guildflow.
