Hi! My name is Mike Zornek. I'm a programmer and geek from Philadelphia, PA.

As I was finishing up college and trying **to kickstart my technical career I began attending various meetups** around the city. Most were technical with a focus on programming. Through these meetup groups I learned a ton and met some great people, many who have become close friends. I even landed a few work opportunities. At the time I just thought of myself as a casual meetup attendee.

**Fast forward 15 years I found myself helping to run a very successful meetup group** that focuses on Apple-related programming called [Philly CocoaHeads](http://phillycocoa.org/). The group started small but at some point we joined Meetup.com to help get some exposure and grown the group. For a while, it worked well.

**Eventually things at Meetup.com just felt stagnant.** The price seemed higher than the value it was providing, the platform features were not really evolving and the updates we saw seemed to be more focused on branding and not really about solving our issues. We also felt locked in, since we did not have access to the emails of our members and any theoretical transition would be harder than it should have to be.

**In 2017 Meetup.com was bought by WeWork and this worried me greatly.** I've been an active observer of the coworking ecosystem and WeWork has always been a poisonous entity in my mind. At it's most innocent the acquisition was a way to push WeWork offices as meetup venues but at worst **I feared they would start selling member data** access to marketers. 

**I started to wonder, if Meetup.com would even be around in a few years.**

Around this time I was looking to explore new projects. I was particularly interested in doing something on the web after more than a decade of focusing on iOS. The project that would come to be known as **Guildflow, started as a side project with a few initial commits in April 2019** and slowly in-between client contracts started to come together.

By October 2019 Meetup.com was experimenting with some new monetization options which would push a $2 charge directly at members per event and this outranged many people. Lots of alternatives started to pop up. I was kind of bummed Guildflow was not ready yet, but kept my head down and continued making progress and interviewing other organizers to better understand how their own groups worked.

More time passed and I continued to make progress. Then in March 2020 COVID hit the US and everything changed.


By now I was able to host my own Android Book Club and Philly Elixir group using Guildflow.

At this point, looking to get into a new project I though I would do some exploration on the idea of a Meetup.com competitor. My first commit was on April 10, 2019 at 3:42 PM to the project that is now known as Guildflow.


Turns out in time they outright [tried to charge our member directly](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20893343/meetup-users-furious-new-rsvp-payment-test).


SCREENSHOT

I'll be honest, having been so focused on iPhone development over the last decade, getting back into web development has been a long journey. I can happily share things are moving faster as I've found my jam in Elixir / Phoenix.

While still in beta, Guildflow has found it's focus squarely on helping people run technical meetups. The platform has a lot of foundation things working -- I myself am hosting my own Android Book Club and Philly Elixir group using Guildflow -- and there are some great features on deck that I'm really excited about.

I'm also excited about the book. While Guildflow is all about software issues, this book is all about people issues, and helping people 

If you've gotten this far, thanks so much for your interest in Guildflow. 

If you help run a technical meetup I'd love to hear from you and find out how I can help our, software things or people things.





 at worst they have [aggressive monetization plans](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/10/15/meetup-users-revolt-against-2-event-feeand-blame-wework/#2dc5fee31d59) to charge my own members for access to events.

At this point I start wondering if Meetup.com is even going to be around in a few years?
