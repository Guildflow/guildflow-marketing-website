My name is Mike Zornek and I am a developer and a long time meetup organizer from Philadelphia, PA.

I created Guildflow because I saw how stagnant and abrasive Meetup.com had become over the last few years, particularly when it was part of the WeWork company. I started to wonder if Meetup.com would even be around in a few more years.

Looking to sink my teeth into a new project I started what is now known as Guildflow. Guildflow's goal is to help people run successful meetups that focus on technology and programming.
