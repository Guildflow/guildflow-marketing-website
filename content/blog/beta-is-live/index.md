If you would like to join the beta, you'll need to schedule a 30 minute video chat.

During this video chat we will:

* Setup your group
* Demo how to create events
* Review how to add members
* Talk about group setting options
* And answer any other questions

Use the link below to pick a time that's good for both of us!
