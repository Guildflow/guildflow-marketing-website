title: "Evolve or Die: It's Time to Rethink Meetup Groups"
date: 2020-08-30T14:10:57-04:00
description: While meetups have lots of individual and social benefits, many have not evolved and are on a declining trajectory. In today’s video we’ll ponder as to the causes of this decline and how you can evolve your own meetup group to not only survive, but thrive.

Discussion topics from the video:

* My ongoing research into meetup groups. [Still looking for more people to interview too!](http://mikezornek.com/posts/2020/8/help-me-with-an-introduction-to-your-meetup-organizer/)
* Technical meetups on the decline. Why?
	* Part of it is the avalanche of technical information online.
	* Part of it is people being able to more easily find and connect with same minded people.
	* COVID has only expedited the decline.

**If your meetup is limited to meeting once a month, at a building to eat pizza and talk about a technology, I fear you may not be around in 5 more years.**

* There are still a ton of great benefits from a working meetup community.
* How should meetups evolve?
	* More events, smaller events.
	* Some in-person, some online.
	* Social events: hack nights, side project saturday, show and tell.
	* Goal-oriented events: book clubs, workshops, mentoring, masterminds, [side project time bartering](http://mikezornek.com/posts/2020/8/bartering-with-other-developers-on-side-projects/).
	* Passive connections: Chatting and DM via Slack or Discord.
	* Maybe do bigger 6-month events, dinners / mixers?
	* Need to spend more time onboarding new members when the group lives online.
