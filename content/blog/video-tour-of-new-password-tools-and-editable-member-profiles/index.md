On Friday, July 10th, I released version 0.6.2 of Guildflow. Big changes include:

* A new [public Changelog](/changelog/).
* Default passwords for members who are created manually are now properly randomized.
* Members can now reset their passwords with an emailed link.
* Member profiles are now editable and currently include first and last name as well as a freeform bio that will render Markdown content.

Thanks for your interest in Guildflow!
