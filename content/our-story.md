# The Guildflow Story

## The Short Version

After using Meetup.com for many years the platform felt very stagnant and once [WeWork](https://www.wired.com/story/weworks-failure-is-softbanks-day-of-reckoning/) [got involved](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20893343/meetup-users-furious-new-rsvp-payment-test) as an owner the larger concern was, *"Is Meetup.com even going to be around in a few years?"* 

The good news is Meetup.com [has been sold from WeWork](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/wework-sells-off-social-network-meetup-to-alleycorp-and-other-investors/) and there is hope they will turn it around, BUT…

*I believe the window is open to provide something better, specifically for technical meetups.* 

Guildflow is a new effort to be the best place on the web to host and run a technical meetup group. 

Please check out the current offering and [let me know](/contact) what you think and what is missing. My job is to help you run a successful group, and this goes well beyond software. *Please, ask for help. I want to help!*

Hi! My name is Mike Zornek. I'm a programmer and geek from Philadelphia, PA.

As I was finishing up college and trying to kickstart my own technical career I began attending various meetups around the city. Most were technical, many focused on programming. Through these groups I learned a ton and met lots of great people, many who have become close friends. I even landed a few work opportunities. At the time I just thought of myself as a casual meetup attendee.

Fast forward many years I find myself helping to run a very successful meetup group that focuses on Apple-related programming called CocoaHeads.

The group started small but at some point we joined Meetup.com to help get some group exposure and for the most part it worked well. Over the next few years we continued to use Meetup.com and grew the group.

Eventually things just felt stagnant. The Meetup.com price seemed higher than the value it was generating, the platform features were not really evolving and the updates we saw seemed to be focused on branding and not really solving our pains. 

There was also this undercurrent of no trust. We had no access to the email addresses of our members so if we ever did decide to use something else, any transition would be harder than it should have to be.

In 2017 [Meetup.com is bought by WeWork](https://www.wired.com/story/why-wework-is-buying-meetup/) and this worried me greatly. I've been an active observer of the coworking ecosystem and WeWork has always been a poisonous entity in my mind.

At it's most innocent the Meetup.com acquisition was a way for WeWork to push WeWork offices as meetup venues but at worst I worried they would start selling member data access to marketers. (Turns out a few year later they outright tried to charge our member directly.)

At this point, looking to get into a new project I though I would do some exploration on the idea of a Meetup.com competitor. My first commit was on April 10, 2019 at 3:42 PM to the project that is now known as Guildflow.

SCREENSHOT

I'll be honest, having been so focused on iPhone development over the last decade, getting back into web development has been a long journey. I can happily share things are moving faster as I've found my jam in Elixir / Phoenix.

While still in beta, Guildflow has found it's focus squarely on helping people run technical meetups. The platform has a lot of foundation things working -- I myself am hosting my own Android Book Club and Philly Elixir group using Guildflow -- and there are some great features on deck that I'm really excited about.

I'm also exictied about the book. While Guildflow is all about software issues, this book is all about people issues, and helping people 

If you've gotten this far, thanks so much for your interest in Guildflow. 

If you help run a technical meetup I'd love to hear from you and find out how I can help our, software things or people things.





 at worst they have [aggressive monetization plans](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/10/15/meetup-users-revolt-against-2-event-feeand-blame-wework/#2dc5fee31d59) to charge my own members for access to events.

At this point I start wondering if Meetup.com is even going to be around in a few years?
