The platform is still in-development but available now as a Public Alpha. This means many features are incomplete and probably broken. Users should expect things to change, sometimes in breaking ways, and know the site still lacks production-acceptable backup and export systems.

This Public Alpha is being released to help generate much needed feedback. If you have time and interested in our cause please, [create a group](/create-group), try things out, and [send in your observations](/contact). Thank you.
