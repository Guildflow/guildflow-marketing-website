        <p>My name is <strong>Mike Zornek</strong> and I'm a fellow meetup organizer from Philadelphia, PA.</p>
        <p>Meetup groups are a great way to share and give back to your community. Through organizing meetups I have
            met some incredible peers, many who have become dear friends. I've learned a ton of technical knowledge and
            experienced countless career opportunities.</p>
        <p>After a growing discontent with the meetup tools of the day I started to build out something new that lets
            group organizers own their data and respected the privacy of group members. I am really excited how it's
            starting to take shape.</p>
        <p>Please explore what Guildflow has to offer and <a href="/contact">let me know</a> what you like and feel it
            is
            missing. I'd love to
            hear about your own meetup group
            experiences.
