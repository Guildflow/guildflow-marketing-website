        <p>My name is <strong>Mike Zornek</strong> and I'm a fellow meetup organizer from Philadelphia, PA.</p>
        <p>I have a long history of participating in meetup groups; helping to organize the <a
                href="http://phillycocoa.org">Philly CocoaHeads</a> (an Apple developer group) for many years and am
            currently leading the <a href="https://phillyelixir.clubhouse.host/">Philly Elixir Group</a>.</p>
        <p>Meetup groups are a great way to share and give back to your community. Through organizing meetups I have
            met some incredible peers, many who have become dear friends. I've learned a ton of technical knowledge and
            experienced countless career opportunities.</p>
        <p>After a growing discontent with the meetup tools of the day I started to build out something new that let
            group organizers own their data and respected the privacy of group members. I am really excited how it's
            starting to take shape.</p>
        <p>Please take a look for yourself and <a href="/contact">reach out to me</a>. I'd love to
            hear about your own meetup
            experiences.
