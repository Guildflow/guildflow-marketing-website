        <h1>3 Reasons to Avoid Using Meetup.com</h1>

        <p class="italic text-gray-500">Don't let your group be held for ransom.</p>

        <h2>You will not own your group.</h2>

        <p>The group you create is not yours; you are making a group within the Meetup.com website.</p>

        <p>Should you
            <strong>fail
                to keep your payment subscription active the group will be "sold"</strong> on a first come, first serve
            basis to
            the current membership. I've even heard horror stories where a credit card expired and without even an
            email notice the "for sale" email-bast was sent out.</p>

        <h2>You will not have access to member email addresses.</h2>

        <p>Vendor lock-in is when you use a service and the service operator finds a way to make it extremely
            difficult to switch to a competitor.</p>

        <p>Meetup.com does vendor lock-in by not allowing you access to the
            email address of you groups members. By withholding this information you can not contact the membership
            outside of the website, nor can you easily migrate the group to another service.</p>

        <p><strong>Meetup.com is like
                a roach motel for groups; once you go in, you can't get out. </strong></p>

        <h2>You can not use your own domain.</h2>

        <p>When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. The best way to ensure
            you have control is to use a domain that you own and can point anywhere. Meetup.com does not allow this
            behavior. </p>
