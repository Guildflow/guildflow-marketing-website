    <h2 id="I don’t have the time, I have no idea how to get started.">I don’t have the time, I have no idea how to
        get started.</h2>
    <p>Running a meetup group does take <u>some time</u>, but lucky for you Guildflow is here to help. Lots of
        organizer tasks can be automated and simplified into basic checklist-style lists. </p>

    <p><b>Guildflow will teach you</b> what you need to do and why it’s important for the heath of your group. </p>

    <p><b>Guildflow will automate</b> what can be automated so you can spend more time with people and less time
        with software.</p>

    <h2 id="Who is going to speak at these events?">Who is going to speak at these events?</h2>
    <p><b>You don’t need speakers to start a meetup.</b> While a hallmark of mature groups is members presenting to
        other members, in the early days there are lots of non-presentation, goal-oriented events you can host.
        <b>Book clubs</b>, <b>code jams</b>, <b>architecture practice sessions</b>, <b>pair programming with code
            katas</b> and <b>open source project days</b> are all great ways to get people to show up and
        collaborate.</p>

    <h2 id="Should I even bother during COVID?">Should I even bother during COVID?</h2>
    <p><b>If life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade.</b> While we are all anxious to get back to
        face-to-face events, there are many advantages to starting a new technical meetup group right now.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Some people have a extra time and are looking for personal growth opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>Online events are cheaper to run with no venue fees or food costs so more room for experimentation.
        </li>
        <li>While online events tend to draw fewer people, the social bonds of those people who show up can
            sometimes be even stronger for it.
        </li>
        <li><b>There is a large social need for people helping people right now, this could be a path for that; one
                that you are uniquely qualified to offer.</b>
        </li>

    <h1 id="Using Guildflow to Launch Your Meetup">Using Guildflow to Launch Your Meetup</h1>
    <p>Guildflow is dedicated to technical meetups and provides the distinct tools new organizers need to help guide
        them in creating successful groups. </p>

    <h2 id="Step 1: Build a home base: your group website.">Step 1: Build a home base: your group website.</h2>
    <p>Prospective members need <b>a starting point</b> and current members need <b>a place to call home</b>, this
        will be your Guildflow group website. </p>

    <p>With some basic background about your group, you’ll quickly have <b>a custom group website with all the
            foundation tools you need.</b></p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Curate members</b> through customizable membership applications.
        </li>
        <li><b>Host events</b>, collect RSVPs and archive slides to create a rich archive of group knowledge.
        </li>
        <li><b>Publish custom pages</b> with Markdown content to share group rules and expectations.
        </li>
        <li><b>Communicate with your members</b> though event-specific or broadcast-level emails.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="Step 2: Define your flow: the leadership task list.">Step 2: Define your flow: the leadership task list.
    </h1>
    <p><b>Everything in life is easier with a checklist.</b> While organizing a meetup group through Guildflow
        you’ll have access to a dynamic lifecycle-based task list that helps you and the rest of your leadership
        team design and execute the meetup experience you want to deliver to your members.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Craft lifecycle tasks</b> that need to be done for:
            <ul>
                <li> each event type
                </li>
                <li> new member onboarding
                </li>
                <li> inactive members checkins
                </li>
                <li> sponsorships responsibilities
                </li>
                <li> and custom groups.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Share the task list and its responsibilities</b> with your fellow leadership team.
        </li>
        <li><b>Save time through automations</b> like posting event announcements to Twitter or new members to
            Slack.
        </li>
        <li><b>Customize your solution</b> through a modern GraphQL API endpoint.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>HOW DO I VISUALIZE THIS?</p>

    <h1 id="Step 3: Don’t wait, get started!">Step 3: Don’t wait, get started!</h1>
    <p><b>My only regret is, I wish I had started sooner.</b> Technical meetup groups, and communities in general,
        are a long game. Better to start now and evolve as you learn than to do nothing. </p>

    <h1 id="Guildflow vs Meetup.com">Guildflow vs Meetup.com</h1>
    <p>A few things to keep in mind when considering Guildflow vs <a href="http://Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> to host
        your group.</p>

    <p><b>Data Ownership.</b> Unlike <a href="http://Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a>, You own your group with Guildflow.
        If you choose not to renew your subscription, we won’t sell your group to the first person who shows up with
        a working credit card number. In fact, Guildflow has a dedicated system to allow you to export and migrate
        your data off Guildflow should you find a better solution for your group as it grows and evolves. No hard
        feelings.</p>

    <p><b>Member Emails and API Access.</b> <a href="http://Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> hides access to member emails
        and limits their API access behind their most expensive subscription Meetup Pro, which is $35/month. The API
        limits are a particularly sore point for some developers who saw a community come together to help the
        company validate the early API back, built lots of integrations around it only to have the goal post moved
        and all those systems break when the API access was moved to be behind the tallest paywall. </p>

    <p><b>Better Privacy Options.</b> Unlike <a href="http://Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> Guildflow defaults to
        privacy for things like publishing a group’s member list, and thus the individual member details and social
        media info. Even within a group members have more options about sharing or not sharing their RSVP status. As
        the world starts to appreciate the implications and importance of privacy, Guildflow wants to be a good
        privacy citizen, with strong privacy defaults and clear member options when they want to share more.</p>

    <hr>
    <h1 id="Pricing">Pricing</h1>
    <p>Simple, honest pricing. Each group subscription fee is <b>$14 / month or $140 / year</b>. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Up to 1,000 members.
        </li>
        <li>Up to 10,000 broadcast emails
        </li>
        <li>20 GBs of media storage for presentation slides.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If Guildflow is not saving you personal time worth that subscription cost, then I’ll eat my hat.</p>

    <h2 id="Founding Group Special">Founding Group Special</h2>
    <p>For those people excited about Guildflow and looking for guaranteed early access during the beta, we have a
        founding group special.</p>

    <p><b>If you commit you Guildflow for the year, at $140, you’ll get two years of service for the price of
            one.</b></p>

    <p>This offer is only available through the end of November 2020 so if you are interested, please get in contact
        and book a demo.</p>
